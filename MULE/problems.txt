problems in game

character selection screen
    *thumbnails and names of characters need to be implemented
    *occasionally, i will make a character and the game will just reset the player selection. the last time it happened, i tried every color of squirrel with the name "be" before it finally worked when i changed the name to "asdfjklaslk" 
    *hover buttons
    *when cat race is selected, the cat race graphic is shifted over to the left for some reason 
map
    *store inventory is not displayed
    *font color is incorrect

    *stop button needs to be implemented
    *game should pause when player turn ends with message at bottom indicating a change in player
    *map 1 should always return the given standard map while maps 2-5 can have randomly generated terrains
