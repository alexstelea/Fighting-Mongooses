/**
 * Each turn there is a chance that a random event will happen. Each round, a player has a 
 * 27% chance that a random event will happen. No bad event can happen to the player with the 
 * lowest score.
 *
 * Some events require a price calculation. This is dependent on a factor m. 
 * m is determined by what round the game is in. 
 * Round	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	11	12 
 * m	    25	25	25	50	50	50	50 75	75	75	75	100
 *
 * If an event does happen, then one of the following events is chosen:
 *
 * YOU JUST RECEIVED A PACKAGE FROM THE GT ALUMNI CONTAINING 3 FOOD AND 2 ENERGY UNITS.
 * A WANDERING TECH STUDENT REPAID YOUR HOSPITALITY BY LEAVING TWO BARS OF ORE.
 * THE MUSEUM BOUGHT YOUR ANTIQUE PERSONAL COMPUTER FOR $8*m.
 * YOU FOUND A DEAD MOOSE RAT AND SOLD THE HIDE FOR $2*m.
 * FLYING CAT-BUGS ATE THE ROOF OFF YOUR HOUSE. REPAIRS COST $4*m.
 * MISCHIEVOUS UGA STUDENTS BROKE INTO YOUR STORAGE SHED AND STOLE HALF YOUR FOOD.
 * YOUR SPACE GYPSY INLAWS MADE A MESS OF THE TOWN. IT COST YOU $6*m TO CLEAN IT UP.
