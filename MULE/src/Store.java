 * ore to the store, then no mules can be produced after the initial 
 * amount are sold.
 * 
 * To buy something, the player enters the store during their turn 
 * and is presented with a menu of items to buy. The player may buy 
 * whatever they like subject to them having enough money to purchase 
 * the item. If you have a mule, you cannot buy another until you 
 * emplace the one you have.
 *
 * When a Mule is purchased, it must also be configured, so the following fees are added to the base price.
 * So an energy mule would cost 100 + 50 = 150.
